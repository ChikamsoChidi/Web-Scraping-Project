# Web-Scraping-Project

This web scraping project aims to extract product information from Squire.com, a popular barber location finder platform in the UK. The project will utilize Selenium to crawl and extract data from Squire's marketplace, focusing on names of barbing shops, addresses, cities and provinces. The extracted data will be stored in a structured format (CSV) for analysis, providing valuable insights into Squire's product offerings, market trends, and customer preferences, ultimately informing business decisions and strategy development
